# Smart Contract Addresses
# This file contains the deployed contract addresses for the Food Agriculture Supply Chain system
# 
# IMPORTANT: These addresses are generated after deployment and will be different for each network
# 
# Format: ContractName = Address (Network)
# 
# Example addresses (replace with actual deployed addresses):
# 
# === LOCALHOST (Hardhat) ===
# These are the actual deployed contract addresses from the frontend code

# 
# === DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS ===
# 
# To get actual addresses:
# 1. Run: yarn hardhat deploy --network [network_name]
# 2. Check console output for deployed addresses
# 3. Update this file with the actual addresses
# 
# Networks available:
# - localhost (for local testing)
# - polygonAmoy (Polygon testnet)
# 
# === VERIFICATION ===
# 
# After deployment, verify contracts on block explorers:
# - Polygon Amoy: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/
# - Polygon Mainnet: https://polygonscan.com/
# 
# Verification command:
# yarn hardhat verify --network [network_name] [contract_address] [constructor_args]
