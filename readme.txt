FOOD AGRICULTURE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
==============================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
This is a comprehensive blockchain-based food and agriculture supply chain management system built on the Polygon blockchain. The system tracks food products from farm to consumer, providing complete transparency, quality assurance, and real-time verification capabilities.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
===================

The system consists of four main layers:

1. BLOCKCHAIN LAYER (Smart Contracts)
   - Core business logic implemented in Solidity
   - Deployed on Polygon blockchain for scalability
   - Oracle integration for real-time data feeds

2. BACKEND SERVICES LAYER
   - Weather API service for environmental data
   - Price oracle integration
   - File storage management

3. FRONTEND APPLICATIONS LAYER
   - Admin Portal: For supply chain stakeholders
   - Public Portal: For consumers and verification

4. EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS
   - OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
   - Chainlink oracles for price feeds
   - S3 for file storage
